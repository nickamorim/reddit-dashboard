# reddit-dashboard
Interactive reddit dashboard made w/ vue.js

## Getting Started
Start a local web server to enable cross-origin AJAX requests to the reddit API. The easiest way to do this on OS X/Ubuntu is by running the following command from the project's directory:

``` python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080 ```
If everything is done properly our project should be available at localhost:8080.
